                                   PacificMUN had a humble beginning. While it started as a day conference in 2014, it has grown into one of Vancouver’s premier hotel MUN conferences. However, this journey did not happen overnight. After being founded by Jeff Wu, PacificMUN’s current chairman of the board, it operated as a day conference for two years with moderate success. PacificMUN’s true beginning, however, stems from Bryan Buraga’s decision to transform the day conference into a three-day hotel conference, in an attempt to break into the competitive Vancouver hotel conference scene. Inevitably, PacificMUN faced challenges, from the pure lack of experience in running large scale events, or the constant comments of failure, but we kept pushing.

                              <p class="TI">
                                    PacificMUN was eventually built into a conference with other 600 attendees, a world-class keynote, and the memories for delegates to remember for the rest of their life.
                                    Moving forward, Saad Yasin and Alan Milligan will lead the effort to carry on last year's innovation, perseverance, and quality.
                                    After going from 14 secretariat applications in 2016 to over 50 this year, we have built a team of 10 that will continue PacificMUN’s legacy, turning it from a new grassroots conference to a premier conference that lasts indefinitely.
                                    Our story will not end here though, after hopefully two successful years, we look forward to seeing PacificMUN for years to come.

                                          We want all of our attendees to remember PacificMUN for its moments of passion, fun times with friends, and opportunities to enjoy learning about the world.
                                          To ensure those memories are made, it is our hope to run a flawless conference.
                                          We want every step of the way to be a breeze for all involved, and for their conference memories to be void of any bad experiences.

                                          Our dream is not just about the conference itself, it is also about who can attend.
                                          We believe strongly in accessibility, and it is our dream that financial limitations will not become an obstacle in any students participation in our conference.
                                          Above all, we want PacificMUN to be a highlight of someone's high school career.

                                          He has participated in Model UN since the end of Grade 9, and tried to be as involved in the community as possible ever since.
                                          If he looks familiar, that may be because he spent last year at PacificMUN as one of the USG of Committees!

Normally people would put a “spare time” section here, but Alan doesn’t have any spare time. In the time that he is not doing an above activity, he can be found stressing over university applications, and wishing standardized tests were a nightmare. He looks forward to making PacificMUN an amazing experience for everyone, and hopes to see you there!

                                          Returning to PacificMUN, Saad Yasin is a rising senior at Fraser Heights Secondary.
                                          Starting Model United Nations in the 9th grade, he made sure to attend any conferences that he could register for.
                                          He has been engrossed in Model UN ever since and is proud to say that PacificMUN 2018 will now be his 30th conference.

                                          In the rare instance that Saad isn't working on PacificMUN, you can see him keeping himself occupied with debate, student council, or maintaining his school's MUN club, among various other activities.
                                          When wishing to relax, Saad can be seen binging Netflix, playing sports, or just hanging out with friends.
                                          With his strong commitment to MUN, Saad helped initialize Pacific Model United Nations as the USG of Conference.
                                          Now as the Director-General he will be working even harder to make sure that PacificMUN goes above and beyond to be the most premium yet affordable conference.

                                          He participates in Model United Nations due to his integral interest in the sport, rather than because he wants something to write about in his university applications (although it is a nice byproduct).
                                          Currently, he attends Fraser Heights Secondary as a Grade 12 student.

                                          You can find him usually in front of his computer doing basic internet things, such as Youtube, Facebook, Twitch, games, music, Reddit, Netflix, actual important things (rarely), etc.
                                          He is absolutely ecstatic to be serving as the Chief of Staff for PacificMUN 2018, and is excited to see the success and diversity of each committee.

                                          She has been involved with Model United Nations since grade 10 and has been in love with it ever since.
                                          She hopes that she will be able to combine her love of spreadsheets and her love of international relations together to provide the best delegate experience possible.

                                          More often than not, she can also be found teaching people how to pronounce her name.

                                          When he’s not busy with schoolwork or attending MUNs, Mingxin enjoys taking photos, drinking bubble tea, planning Student Council events at school, and riding his bike around the city.
                                          PacificMUN 2018 will sadly be one of Mingxin’s last MUN experiences, and he hopes that it will be an enjoyable experience for all!
