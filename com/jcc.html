                                    Χαιρετίσματα (Chairetísmata) delegates, and welcome to where it all began.
                                    We all know how important Greece was to the establishment of modern political ideologies, so let’s skip the sweet talk and get to what put all that at risk:
                                    the Peloponnesian War; a time where Greece was divided in half between those who wanted a Greek Empire and those who didn’t.
                                    The original First World War, this 30-year war pitted Greece’s top militaries against each other: Athens’ navy and Sparta’s army.
                              </p><br>
                              <p class="TI">
                                    The sides could not have been more balanced, and the reward was control of all Greece, something everyone at the time wanted.
                                    You have been placed in the positions of the most important people and heads of state in Greece at the time:
                                    representing different city-states and their alignments during the most turbulent time in Ancient Greek history.
                                    Not only that, but you are at war, and everything you do will have rewards and consequences that can change everything.
                                    Experience what it’s like to fight in a simpler time: when no one cared about their “international image” or “reputation,” a time where the leader was whoever had the sharpest spears and the most brilliant strategies, not whoever spoke the best.
                                    In this JCC, the limits are your own creativity and tactical expertise. We shall see you there, Kalí týchi.

                                          Although no longer in high school, Emad has way too many positive memories from Model UN  to give it up. PacificMUN 2017 was a resounding success in Emad's eyes, as he directed his best crisis committee to date there: the Canada-Quebec Joint Crisis Committee. Hungry for seconds, he now comes back for more and presents to you the PacificMUN 2018 Joint Crisis Committee: The Peloponnesian War (Athens vs. Sparta). This committee has been a dream of his for years now, and he's finally reached a stage where he is ready to put it to the test. The main challenge this time lies not in making sure committee runs smoothly or that all delegates participate, because they definitely will, but Emad needs to balance his dedication to MUN with his university requirements and to make sure he works enough hours in a week to still have a place to live. Right before mid-term season hits, Emad wants to take a break; and he's happy this break is PacificMUN 2018. See everyone there!

                                          Eric is a senior attending St. George's School. After beginning his MUN journey in grade 7, he fell in love with how professional, yet fun, MUN was. In his free time, you can find Eric playing basketball, chasing curved pieces of plastic, watching moving pictures, investing in bitcoin, making "fantastic" puns, and creating the most horrendous grammar mistakes. Eric is looking forward to Bloc Directing at PacificMUN 2018 and hopes to make it an unforgettable experience for everybody. If you ever see him out of committee session, feel free to say hi to him, or to yell his name and then proceed to dab.

                                          Geneviève Dubuc is currently a senior attending École Secondaire Jules-Verne and she is delighted to serve as the Chair of the Joint Crisis Committee at Pacific Model United Nations 2018. Passionate about international affairs, MUN piqued her curiosity and she attended her first conference at the beginning of eleventh grade. Conference after conference, she only delved deeper into the world of debate and has not turned back since. When she is not in school, sleeping, or doing both simultaneously, you can find Geneviève being an avid dogspotter, sobbing while watching Korean dramas or seeking new eateries to feed her insatiable sweet tooth. Geneviève looks forward to a weekend of fervent debate and she is excited to meet you all at Pacific Model United Nations 2018.

                                          Simon is a grade 12 student at Pinetree Secondary. He started MUN in the beginning of his grade 9 year and has been deeply involved in participating in such activities ever since.  He believes that MUN has truly assisted him in public speaking and how it can help everyone learn in one way or another.

                                          Outside of MUN, Simon is a Petty Officer First Class in Cadets, and also a leader in Pinetree Secondary’s Student Council. He also enjoys volunteering for random events when he has the time to do so. He is very active in musical programs as he claims he can play six instruments with the trumpet and drums being his main. You can usually find him in a jam session with his friends or debating with others on how jazz is a superior type of music. All in all, Simon looks forward to staffing at PacificMUN 2018 and hopes it will be enjoyable for everybody.

Since attending his first conference in grade 11, Peter has been mesmerized by public speaking, international relations, and the Machiavellian power politics that give crisis committees their flavor. When Peter isn’t participating in Model UN conferences, you can find him making puns involving the reversal of his first and last name, and reading political books for his amusement. Additionally, you can find him volunteering on various political campaigns, and helping his friends with their math homework.

He is honored to serve as the chair of JCC at PacificMUN 2018 and is beyond excited to meet all the delegates attending the conference. Kevin has been an active participant of MUN ever since his passion for public speaking compelled him to join in his grade 8 year, and has staffed on multiple occasions during his five-year career. In his spare time, Kevin can be found debating, reading, volunteering, as well as playing the piano for leisure and relaxation; a healthy dose of web surfing also helps him through the day. He cannot wait for PacificMUN 2018, where he will commit his utmost effort to ensure that all participants have a rewarding time.

She first delved into the world of Model United Nations in grade 8 and has been actively participating in conferences ever since. One of her favorite aspects of MUN is the opportunity to meet and interact with people from all over the lower mainland, so she is greatly anticipating meeting all the delegates! This will be her first time staffing a crisis committee, and is looking forward to hearing fruitful debate!

She also greatly enjoys learning different languages and can converse in somewhat broken Spanish and French. If you spot her at the conference, feel free to say hi and introduce yourself! She hopes that delegates will find this committee to be both an engaging and refreshing experience.
