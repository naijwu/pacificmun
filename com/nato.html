                        <p>
                              Born out of the military tension between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), an intergovernmental military alliance, was formed. The alliance between the democratic nations from Europe and North America had the primary objective to deter the Communist expansion and ensure mutual defence.
                              NATO granted collective security to all its members as a way to strengthen itself against the communist Warsaw Pact.
                              While the Warsaw Pact no longer exists in the modern era, NATO continues with its goals to achieve security and peace.
                              Now, with 29 member states, NATO’s role extends beyond establishing collective security; it is actively involved in a broad range of peacekeeping operations.
                              These range from countering international threats to providing humanitarian assistance in post-conflict zones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                              Unlike other intergovernmental bodies, NATO has the ability to enforce resolutions and decisions rather than just propose ideas.
                              All operations of NATO require the unanimous consent from their Member-States.
                              As the most powerful military organization in the world, NATO wields enormous political influence and is vital in maintaining peace and security across the globe.

                                    When the Soviet Union collapsed, the communist nation of North Korea was left to defend itself from the largest global superpower, the United States. This led to the Kim Dynasty's belief that improving their military was their only source of security. Therefore, the nation started to develop their own nuclear capabilities. After witnessing the US invade Iraq due to their alleged nuclear arms and eliminate Libya’s nuclear program, Kim Jong-Il’s government relentlessly continued to test and develop their nuclear arms.
                              </p><br>
                              <p class="TI">
                                    North Korea’s successful production of short and medium-range missiles forces Japan and South Korea to live with the constant threat of a possible nuclear attack. However, their collective security agreement with the US, who possesses nuclear weapons capable of striking North Korea, locked the nations in a temporary stalemate. While economic sanctions and rejection from the United Nations have weakened North Korea’s economy and standard of living, their pursuit for military supremacy remains unshaken. Their survival is mainly backed by China who is their main trading partner and ally. North Korea’s successful development of an ICBM (Intercontinental Ballistic Missile), meant that the US must re-evaluate their current commitments to defending their allies Japan and Korea. With North Korea theoretically capable of striking all of Asia, most of Europe, and North America, the members of NATO must develop a strategy to curb the rising militarism of North Korea.

                                          Attending her first conference in Grade 10 in an attempt to conquer her fear of public speaking, Nicole was immediately fascinated by the political nature inherent to MUN. Seeking to feel the adrenaline rush produced inside (and outside) the committee sessions, Nicole has since then become a serial MUN delegate, attending both local and international conferences.

                                          Outside of MUN, Nicole enjoys working as a bubble tea barista and participating in Youth Parliament. You can also find Nicole exhausted on the field hockey turf after a few seconds of running and listening to angsty 2000s music. Now as a senior, she is thrilled to serve as the director of NATO at PacificMUN 2017. She sincerely hopes that the issues discussed will provide a more refined and multidimensional understanding of the militarism in North Korea. Nicole looks forward to meeting everyone at PacificMUN 2017, and aspires to provide an enriching and transformative experience to the delegates!

In addition to Model UN and academic studies, Sherry enjoys working for nonprofit organizations, performing with her orchestra, and baking macarons in her free time.
