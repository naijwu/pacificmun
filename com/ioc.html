                        <p>
                              The International Olympic Committee (IOC) will be a unique committee at Pacific MUN 2018. Although not a traditional UN body, The IOC continues to serve as the world’s utmost authority in regards to all Olympic-related matters. Although its role has diversified with the expansion of the Olympic Games in the modern era, it still has the same responsibilities to logistically direct and coordinate the Olympic Games. The committee focuses on using the games as a tool to promote global social initiatives in coordination with the United Nations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                              Founded in 1894 as a means of planning and coordinating the revitalization of the ancient games, the IOC was made to organize the Olympic Games every two years in the 20th and 21st Centuries. Since then, not only has it been the main organization committee for both the summer and winter games but has also expanded its role as a promoter of the global Olympic Movement. Furthermore, the IOC was granted permanent observer status by the UN as it promotes the use of sports as a means to promote and maintain global peace.

                                    The Olympic Games have always been the pinnacle of human athleticism, but such an event of epic proportions is not one without costs of epic proportions. As the demand for the games has increased in recent years with the rise in the number of events, the costs have spiked as a result of such realities. As seen in recent Olympic Years, the games have been a source of great economic disparity. The sheer magnitude of the games relies on immense streams of infrastructure which can be incredibly costly if not already existent.

                                    The economic state of host nations post-Olympics is of utmost importance to the IOC as it is a measure of the capability to choose host nations. The state of the economy is also important if the result of the games has the ability to inflict any grief upon a nation, as that goes against the principles of the Olympic movement. Subsequently, delegates should be informed on the methods of investigation in the selection of host nations as well as potential methods of assessing specifically liable countries during the process. As well, delegates should look for unique solutions which have the ability to not only mediate the costs of hosting but allow for various nations of different backgrounds to do so. Hopefully, the IOC will be able to restore the past glory of hosting the games in a way that allows the economic expenditures to be mediated.

                                    In light of recent events, the process to choose host cities for the Olympic Games has come under great scrutiny. The fact that the process has been plagued by corruption in order to favour specific nations’ bids defeats the very principles in which the IOC focuses upon. Corruption has seemingly been achieved through a plethora of reasons, however, the main culprit for allowing these atrocities is the current voting process and methods for choosing the host cities. The result of not only condoning corruption, but allowing it to occur has, inherently, shifted the course of the International Olympic Committee.
                              </p><br>
                              <p class="TI">
                                    This has damaged its core pursuit of spreading the Olympic Movement. It has also enabled nations to use the Games for their own ulterior motives instead of those outlined in the Olympic Movement. For instance, the massacre of 27 student protesters at the Mexico City Olympics in 1968 provided a prime example of both, the IOC and host governments, ability to take advantage of preparations via corruptions within both respective committees. With the motives for countries to corrupt the process in picking host cities not seeming to change, and the lack of action in combating these issues from any third party, the IOC must take it upon itself to rid itself from the shackles of corruption.

                                          Jaskirt is currently a junior at Southpointe Academy and is ecstatic to Direct the International Olympic Committee. He has participated in a plethora of different Model United Nation conferences throughout the past three years from which he has developed a strong passion for public speaking, and international affairs. Ever since his first MUN, he has always been attracted to the practical and professional nature of the endeavor. Also, he believes that MUN allows people to meet like-minded youth, foster a deeper understanding of current events, and challenge people to come outside of their comfort zone.

Jaskirt looks forward to helping delegates in whichever capacity that may be and to a fantastic weekend full of productive, and enticing debate at PacificMUN 2018!

                                          From the riveting debates to the formation of great alliances and friendships, Naomi inevitably succumbed to the allure of Model UN after attending her first conference in Grade 10. Now a senior at Little Flower Academy, she accredits MUN for fuelling her desire to learn more about past events that shaped the world around her and understand its correlation to current events that continue to dominate and influence the world today.

Naomi also enjoys attempting to assume the profession of a sports journalist in her spare time - she is very proud of her active Canucks blog (which averages 0.5 readers a month!). Naomi is delighted to serve as Chair of IOC and hopes that all delegates will have a fun experience at PacificMUN 2018!

                                          Annie is a Grade 12 student studying at North Surrey Secondary School. This will be her fourth year of MUN, and she is so excited to share this—how to put it—challenging, immersive, and fun experience with all delegates, both those who are just beginning to explore the world of MUN and those who are well experienced. MUN has been an integral part of her high school career as it carries some of the best memories, from the rigorously fun debate to the amazing people she’s met in the committee room, and she hopes that this PacificMUN 2017 will be an experience made memorable for each delegate attending as well. So don’t hesitate to chat if you want to talk about anything committee related (or not!). In her free time, Annie draws, watches educational Youtube videos to feel productive even though they’re really not, and turns every conversation into a philosophical debate (whoops).
