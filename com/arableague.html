                        <p>
                              The Arab League, originally called the League of Arab States, is a multinational forum for discussion between Arab countries located within and in close proximity to North Africa. It was established in Cairo on March 22, 1945, with 6 founding members. Today it includes 22 member states. However, Syria has been suspended since November 2011 as a consequence of their civil war. The League’s main goal is to foster closer relations between member states and coordinate collaborative initiatives between them. Each member has one vote in the League Council and decisions are only binding for countries that have voted for them.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                              This committee is designed for advanced and intermediate delegates alike. Position papers, although strongly recommended, are not mandatory. Overall, this committee is set to challenge delegates with topics that have sparked debate for decades. Finding a solution will not be easy and requires new ingenuitive thinking.

                                    Oil prices continue to fall like never seen before. Oil and gas based countries are looking to reform their exportation based economies so they can withstand the ramifications of decreasing oil prices. These nations wish to be prepared for the world where oil is no longer the primary source of energy production. While many countries blame Saudi Arabia for the falling prices, the blame cannot be completely attributed to any one nation. In fact, large multi-national corporations should also share the blame for this developing issue. As sustainable growth is needed in the Middle East, falling oil prices, however bad they seem, may just be a blessing in disguise.

                                    	The Sunni and Shia schism dates back to the death of the last Islamic prophet, Muhammad, in the year 632 C.E. No matter how valiantly the Arab states attempt to push past this main division in the Islamic faith. This conflict in beliefs leads many Islamic countries to war amongst themselves. The actions committed in the name of solving this conflict has even lead to the rise of xenophobia in the western world. With tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran at reaching its climax in the race to become the dominant power in the Middle East, the wedge tearing the Middle East apart is the fact that they are unable to accept the legitimacy of the other nation’s dominant faith. The Arab Peace initiative seeks to strike a difficult peace deal with fundamentally different nations. This makes it a topic that requires delicacy, debate, and diplomacy.

                                          Inaya Ali would like to express her greetings to all delegates of PacificMUN 2018. She is honoured to be the Director of the Arab League as it was the first committee she ever participated in and was the main reason she fell in love with MUN. While she enjoys sleeping, being an IB student at Port Moody Secondary School takes up a significant portion of this time. Outside of MUN, Inaya enjoys playing basketball despite her limited height. Inaya views MUN as a place to convey new schools of thought and challenge opposing arguments while still in a controlled environment. Overall, Inaya is ecstatic for the prospect of spending an unforgettable weekend with all delegates at the conference.

                                          Alan is a grade 11 student attending Fraser Heights Secondary and is excited to serve as the chair for LAS. Ever since the first time he raised his placard back in 2015, Alan has proceeded to thoroughly enjoy MUN as a fun medium for debating and socializing. In addition, Alan is also grateful for the learning experiences that MUN provided. From understanding international and historic events to working with others for a common goal, these experiences will no doubt be invaluable later on. Outside of MUN, Alan can be seen cycling, diving, playing his saxophones, procrastinating, and lining up at McDonald’s. Alan looks forward to a weekend of productive debate at PacificMUN 2017!
