                              In order to resolve the political tensions and myriad of security issues the Second World War accentuated, the Disarmament and International Security Committee held its first meeting on January 1946.
                              With the cooperation of all 193 UN members, DISEC is currently at the forefront of ensuring international peace on issues ranging from small arms trade to nuclear proliferation, and on stages such as the Arctic Circle and the digital world of cyber security.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                              As the First Committee of the General Assembly, Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) handles disarmament, global challenges and threats to peace that affect the international community and seeks out solutions to the challenges in the international security regime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                              Unfortunately, as DISEC cannot enforce any legally binding resolutions or direct interventions, it manages international security concerns through their support of collaborative arrangements, establishment of numerous peace treaties, global influence, and recommendations that widen the perspective of the UN.

                                    Terrorism has been a controversial topic long before the “War on Terror” was announced.
                                    From the infamous twin towers to the chain of attacks that took place in Europe, terrorism is an issue that affects the international community both directly and indirectly.
                                    It has become not only a political or a military problem, but a social one, with fear at rise and discriminatory regulations being passed.
                              </p><br>
                              <p class="TI">
                                    While tragic deaths of a terror attack may leave emotional citizens looking for a foreign scapegoat, it’s important to recognize the unconventional truth: many of these terrorists are homegrown, terrorist sympathizers.
                                    To deal with these new domestic terrorists, an one-dimensional travel ban will not suffice.
                                    The international community needs to find a more specific, newly innovated solution.

                                    Often times, a new, rising technology is seen as a beacon of technological revolution, a step forward.
                                    However, we seldom realize that in the wrong hands, these scientific breakthroughs could easily be weaponized and used for destruction and chaos.
                                    While the current regulations on numerous weapons are up to international standards, to a new technology like directed-energy weapons, the boundaries are still yet to be discovered and set.

                              <p class="TI">
                                    To many nations, the capabilities of directed-energy weapons are unknown at best.
                                    To even more nations, the thought of spending precious tax dollars on safeguarding directed-energy weapons is absurd.
                                    However, for the safety of the international community, it’s imperative that we look into how to collaborate together to ensure DEW technology is in check.

                                          Matthew Wang is a grade 12 student at Pacific Academy who is thrilled to serve as the Assistant Director of DISEC for PacificMUN 2018.
                                          Caving into peer pressure, Matthew attended his first Model UN conference in grade 10 and fell in love with MUN’s flair to debate and ‘fruitful’ discussions that have since motivated him to participate in countless conferences.
                                    </p><br>
                                    <p class="ssMp TI">
                                          Matthew is not pulling all-nighters studying for the IB program, he enjoys spending his free time public speaking, programming, and making fun of US politics.
                                          Matthew is a firm believer that innovative solutions can only be achieved through insightful leadership, which is why he encourages all students to participate in debate and Model UN to gain a greater understanding of world issues and foreign affairs.
                                          So along with the rest of his fellow dais members, Matthew wishes all delegates a wonderful conference as he welcomes them to PacificMUN 2018.
                                    </p>
